## Test Latex

Trying \\( \LaTex \\) and now an equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = \Sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \frac{1}/{i} \\)

<div>
$$
g_{\mu \nu} =  \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
- \alpha^{2} & \beta &  0  & 0 \\
\beta & a^{2} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & r^{2}  & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & r^{2} \sin^{2} \theta
\end{array} \right) \;\;\;\;
\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}} dx = \pi \;\;\;\;
1 < 2 \;\;\; 3 > 2
$$
</div>

## Test floating images

{{This is the caption of the image.
A plot of a function in Python!}}((../img/surface.png))

This is a new paragraph to fill up some space. So I will keep typing
until I created a long paragraph. So far I don't think it is long enough.
Let me find something from Wikipedia and copy paste it here.
A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written
beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a
particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.
Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an
expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.
The oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no spaces between
words or other ones, and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating
directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized,
and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common.
The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original paragraphos,
similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group.[3] The Greek
paragraphos evolved into the pilcrow), which in English manuscripts in the
Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences. The hedera leaf
 has also been used in the same way.
There should be an image on the right side of this text.
An empty line separates the paragraphs.

## Test Center Floating Image

{{Images with center floating are
a bit larger allowing for more content in the
caption.}}[[../img/HTML.jpg]]

Images (centered or right floating) can be inserted without caption as well,
by simply leaving the caption part completely empty:


{{}}[[../img/HTML.jpg]]


## Test Right Floating Object

<R><span style="font-size:50px;"> \\( G_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi T_{\mu\nu} \\)  </span></R>

You can also insert any html content in a right floating box by
putting it between ``<R></R>``.
For instance the
image of the equation you are seeing on the right hand side is
in part an html code and in part a latex syntax that is being
converted using MathJax script. The code
that generates it is this:

``<R><span style="font-size:50px;">\\(G_{\mu\nu}=8\pi T_{\mu\nu}\\)</span></R>``

Also you can insert any valid HTML content
in the plain text file. See Makrdown's page %% refmk %% to learn more about how
it handles the HTML contents.

## Test code highligher

<div>
{% highlight python %}
from pylab import *

t = arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
s = sin(2*pi*t)
plot(t, s)

xlabel('time (s)')
ylabel('voltage (mV)')
title('About as simple as it gets, folks')
grid(True)
savefig("test.png")
show()
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

## Test Including File

You can include other html files or text in your source code using:

<pre>
&lt;FILE="myfile.html"&gt;
</pre>
